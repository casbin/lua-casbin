# Installing Lua-Cabsin on OpenResty

## Installing OpenResty
You can follow [this guide](https://blog.openresty.com/en/ubuntu20-or-install/) to install OpenResty on Ubuntu 20.04 if you have not yet installed it.

## Installing and configuring LuaRocks
Run these commands in your terminal to install LuaRocks:
```
wget https://luarocks.org/releases/luarocks-3.3.1.tar.gz
tar zxpf luarocks-3.3.1.tar.gz
cd luarocks-3.3.1
```



build and install LuaRocks:
```
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/openresty/luarocks --with-lua=/usr/local/openresty/luajit/ --with-lua-include=/usr/local/openresty/luajit/include/luajit-2.1 --with-lua-lib=/usr/local/openresty/lualib

make -j8 && sudo make install
```

> Cannot find the unzip command, just execute the apt installation
```
sudo apt install unzip zip
```

To configure LuaRocks for OpenResty, run this command:
```
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/openresty/luajit \
--with-lua=/usr/local/openresty/luajit/ \
--lua-suffix=jit-2.1.0-beta3 \
--with-lua-include=/usr/local/openresty/luajit/include/luajit-2.1
```
and then this:
```
sudo make
sudo make install
```

**NOTE**: 
- This is assuming OpenResty (not the executable) is installed at `/usr/local/`, if it isn't so - replace `/usr/local/` with file path you have installed it in.
- Also assumed is that LuaJIT version is `2.1.0-beta3`, you can check which LuaJIT version it is by doing: `cd /usr/local/openresty/luajit/share/` and then `ls`. It will list a luajit folder like `luajit-2.1.0-beta3`, the suffix here is `jit-2.1.0-beta3`. If this isn't so, replace the suffix accordingly.

## Installing dependencies

You need to install GCC and PCRE as these are dependencies for `lualogging` module and `lrexlib-pcre` module.

To do so:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev
```

**NOTE**: If you use `yum` you could use `pcre` and `pcre-devel` for PCRE.

### Install Casbin

Run this command to install the latest released Casbin version(currently v1.11.0):
```
sudo /usr/local/openresty/luajit/bin/luarocks install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casbin/lua-casbin/master/casbin-1.11.0-1.rockspec
```

**NOTE**: Here too the LuaRocks has its executable at `/usr/local/openresty/luajit/bin/luarocks`, if you have it installed somewhere else for OpenResty replace with that instead.

## Using Lua-Casbin

You can create a lua module for OpenResty applications as shown [here](https://blog.openresty.com/en/or-lua-module/) or add it to your existing lua module:

- In the file where you want to use Casbin, use `local Enforcer = require("casbin")` inside the `content_by_lua_block`. Here is a sample describing usage for basic model/policy and ABAC model/policy:

**Basic model/policy example (nginx.conf file)**
```
worker_processes 1;

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    lua_package_path "$prefix/lua/?.lua;;";

    server {
        listen 8080 reuseport;

        location / {
            default_type text/plain;
            content_by_lua_block {
                local Enforcer = require("casbin")
                local model  = "examples/basic_model.conf" -- The model file path
                local policy  = "examples/basic_policy.csv" -- The policy file path
                
                local e = Enforcer:new(model, policy) -- The Casbin Enforcer
                ngx.say("The result is:")
                ngx.say(e:enforce("alice", "data1", "read")) -- The enforce function with its arguments
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**NOTE**: You need to create an `examples` directory at the top level of your application `/` along with the `conf` directory. And then copy the [basic_model.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casbin/lua-casbin/master/examples/basic_model.conf) and [basic_policy.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casbin/lua-casbin/master/examples/basic_policy.csv) to that `examples` directory.

**ABAC model/policy example (nginx.conf file)**
```
worker_processes 1;

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    lua_package_path "$prefix/lua/?.lua;;";

    server {
        listen 8080 reuseport;

        location / {
            default_type text/plain;
            content_by_lua_block {
                local Enforcer = require("casbin")
                local model  = "examples/abac_rule_model.conf"
    		local policy  = "examples/abac_rule_policy.csv"
    		local sub1 = {
        		Name = "Alice",
        		Age = 16
    		}
    		local sub2 = {
        		Name = "Bob",
        		Age = 20
    		}
    		local sub3 = {
        		Name = "Alice",
        		Age = 65
    		}
    		local e = Enforcer:new(model, policy)
    		ngx.say("The result is:")
    		ngx.say(e:enforce(sub2, "/data1", "read"))
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**NOTE**: Similar to the former example, you need to create an `examples` directory at the top level of your application `/` along with the `conf` directory. And then copy the [abac_rule_model.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casbin/lua-casbin/master/examples/abac_model.conf) and [abac_rule_policy.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casbin/lua-casbin/master/examples/abac_rule_policy.csv) to that `examples` directory.

Then use `sudo openresty -p $PWD/` to start the server and use `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/` to fetch the page which for the above examples should output in:
```
The result is:
true
```

You can check other examples [here](https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/blob/master/tests/main/enforcer_spec.lua) and the Built-In Functions currently supported [here](https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/blob/master/src/model/FunctionMap.lua).
